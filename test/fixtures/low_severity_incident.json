            "text": "Summary: Multiple Cloud products experiencing elevated error rates, latencies or service unavailability in europe-west2\nDescription: We are experiencing an issue with multiple cloud products beginning on Tuesday, 2022-07-19 06:33 US/Pacific.\nOur engineering team continues to investigate the issue.\nWe will provide an update by Tuesday, 2022-07-19 13:15 US/Pacific with current details.\nWe apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.\n**Product Impact:**\n**Google Cloud Storage:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Customers with data in the impacted region will see elevated errors when attempting to read objects\n* Workaround: None at this time.\n* Impact Mitigation time: 08:53 US/Pacific\n**Google BigQuery:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Datasets will be unavailable for the impacted locations.\n* Workaround: None at this time.\n**Google App Engine and Cloud Functions:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Customers may experience high error rates for Google App Engine and Cloud Functions in europe-west2 for requests coming through Cloud Pubsub, Eventarc, Cloud Tasks, and Cloud Scheduler. Pubsub, Eventarc, and Cloud Tasks traffic will be automatically retried once the outage is resolved. Cloud Scheduler requests will need to be resubmitted.\n* Workaround: Customers are advised to fail over to another region if possible.\n* Impact Mitigation time: 11:05 US/Pacific\n**DataFlow:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Dataflow Streaming jobs already running in the impacted area may be stuck. New Dataflow jobs may not start.\n* Workaround: Customers are advised to run their jobs in another region.\n**Cloud Composer:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: All operations will experience downgraded performance in europe-west2.\n* Workaround: None at this time.\n**Cloud Filestore:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: europe-west2-a is unavailable for all customers\n* Workaround: Customers are advised to fail over to another region if possible.\n**Cloud SQL:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Non-HA instances backed by europe-west2-a are hard-down in europe-west2-a. Some HA instances are down in europe-west2-b/c (those with standby in europe-west2-a backed by europe-west2-a). Following operations are failing: Backups, creates, DMS migrations, updates, deletes, recreates (internal), restarts, exports.\n* Workaround: None at this time.\n**MemoryStore for Redis:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Customers will experience timeouts for management api (create,update,delete,etc), and cache flushes\n* Workaround: None at this time.\n**Persistent Disk:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Existing PD devices in europe-west2-a may be unavailable. Replicated PD devices in europe-west2 may see some replica unavailability.\n* Workaround: Create PD devices in a different region/zone.\n* Impact mitigated: Starting at 11:18 US/Pacific, customers should be able to create new PD devices in europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c.\n**API Gateway:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Customers may see elevated 5xx errors in europe-west2\n* Workaround: None at this time.\n**Cloud Spanner**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Customers that stay below our recommended CPU usage 65% SR, 45% MR should not see impact. Customers that are above the limit might see latency impact.\n* Workaround: For eur5 customers can chose to route to europe-west1, no workarounds needed for europe-west2\n**GKE:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Certain portions of clusters with presence in europe-west2-a may be unavailable\n* Workaround: Customers are encouraged to move their workloads to other regions if possible.\n**Looker:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Customers hosted in europe-west2 will experience significantly increased failed requests.\n* Workaround: None at this time.\n**Google Cloud Tasks:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Customers will experience high latency for all API requests. Some queues are not being loaded and they stop eeurope-west2-bcuting tasks. Customers may also see high delivery latency for their tasks, depending on which cell is serving their queues.\n* Workaround: None at this time.\n**Google Compute Engine:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: The impact details for GCE are externalized at https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents/XVq5om2europe-west2-bDSqLtJZUvcH\n* Workaround: Please refer to GCE posting at https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents/XVq5om2europe-west2-bDSqLtJZUvcH\n**Cloud Data Fusion:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis : Customers in europe-west2 may see service disruption when they shut down europe-west2-a and may also see pipeline failures.\n* Workaround: None at this time.\n**Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Customers will be unable to perform any operations on Managed Active Directory (AD) domains which are single region (europe-west2). Customers will also experience a degraded experience if one domain controller is unavailable due to zonal impact.\n* Workaround: None at this time.\n**Vertex AI online prediction**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: End user will experience timeouts\n* Workaround: None at this time.\n**VPC (Traffic Virtnet)**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: VPCs in europe-west2-a currently inaccessible. Customers will also experience 100% packet loss to europe-west2-a. Customers are unable to make any control plane changes in europe-west2-a.\n* Workaround: None at this time.\n**Bigtable:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Service unavailability and elevated latency for some customers in europe-west2.\n* Workaround: None at this time.\n**Cloud Firestore:** * Impact/Diagnosis: Webchannel use of Firestore streaming Listen and Write outage starting around 07:15 US/Pacific\n* Workaround: none\n* Impact Mitigation time: 09:55 US/Pacific\n**Cloud Dataproc:**\n* Impact/Diagnosis: Dataproc cluster creation and scale up may experience elevated error rate in europe-west2-a and europe-west2-c.\n* Workaround: Customers can choose a europe-west2-b or other regions.\nDiagnosis: Product specific symptoms are in the issue description.\nWorkaround: Product specific workaround are in the issue description.",
